# Land of Here Projects Monorepo

This is a monorepo for Land of Here projects. Have a look around!

This monorepo was initially built around Svelte and created as a [template](https://github.com/Studiobear/svelte-monorepo-starter). The monorepo structure makes the tie-in to Svelte superficial as any type of package, not even just JS, can live within. Visit the above template link to find out more about how this monorepo is created and works.
